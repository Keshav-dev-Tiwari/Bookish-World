# Bookish-World
Bookish World Project is a MERN based project that helps in building a platform
for all book readers. This platform helps users to discover new/old book titles,
read their description, view their summary and like posts shared by other readers.
This platform also enables users to share their own recent book titles and
descriptions which they might have read in a while.
# Aim
The main aim of this project is to connect all the book lovers and avid readers out
there, who then share their book lists and reviews. Also, this platform will give
readers a new perspective around the books that they have read, helping them
understand the aspects that they never considered. The key components of
Bookish World are: (i) Explore Book Titles (ii) Add New Book Title
