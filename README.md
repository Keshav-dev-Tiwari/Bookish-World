# Bookish-World
Bookish World Project is a MERN based project that helps in building a platform
for all book readers. This platform helps users to discover new/old book titles,
read their description, view their summary and like posts shared by other readers.
This platform also enables users to share their own recent book titles and
descriptions which they might have read in a while
